# Weakly sporadic F-hollow lattice 3-polytopes

A database containing all weakly sporadic F-hollow lattice 3-polytopes.

## Data Description
The text files "weakly_sporadic_non_sporadic_lattice_width1_degree_leq_1.txt", "weakly_sporadic_non_sporadic_lattice_width1_degree2.txt" and "weakly_sporadic_non_sporadic_lattice_width2.txt" contain vertex data for the weakly sporadic F-hollow lattice 3-polytopes which are not sporadic, i.e. they have a lattice projection onto a F-hollow polytope of smaller dimension. The data are sorted by the degree of the polytopes and their lattice width. Each line of the file contains the vertices of one polytope.

The text files "sporadic_mu_4_over_3.txt", "sporadic_mu_5_over_4.txt" and "sporadic_mu_7_over_6.txt" contain vertex data for the sporadic F-hollow lattice 3-polytopes, i.e. they have no lattice projection onto a F-hollow polytope of smaller dimension. The data are sorted by the minimal multiplier, which is either 4/3, 5/4 or 7/6.
The text files "sporadic_236.txt", "sporadic_244.txt" and "sporadic_333.txt" contain vertex data for the sporadic F-hollow lattice 3-polytopes, which are affine unimodular equivalent to a lattice subpolytope of the simplex with vertices (0,0,0), (i,0,0), (0,j,0), (0,0,k) in the file "spradic_ijk.txt". Note that a sporadic F-hollow lattice 3-polytope can be a subpolytope of more than one of the simplices. Each line of the file contains the vertices of one polytope.
